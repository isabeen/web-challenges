# Website Challenge

## Task

We have:

a <head> section with the <title> (not visible in the browser body);
a <body> containing an <header>, a <main> and a <footer>;
the <header> has a title, a picture, a descriptive paragraph and a navigation;
the <footer> has just a (fake) copyright info;
the <main> contains three <section>s;
each <section> has a title, one or more paragraphs, and if needed a list of additional information.
Try to draft a homepage for:

a cinema / theater;
a restaurant;
a music band;
a public administration office.
Decide first the information you'll need / want to show (pencil and paper go a long way), then work on the HTML.

## Development

Run `npm run start` to start a development server and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

> Alternatively you can use the Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code to view this project.  
> Select the HTML file you want to view, press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>, search for `Live Preview: Show Preview` and confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
